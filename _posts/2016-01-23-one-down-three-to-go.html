          <p>What a whirlwind these last few weeks have been! From the first day of excitement and challenging myself to dive into Echo
          with well under 1,000 hours of experience, to being quite sure a few days later that I had made a poor choice, to then being super excited yet again about turning the letter 'a' into braille-like text of zeroes and dots... it's hard to explain all the ups and downs one goes through when struggling to succeed in this course. I know that I still have a long way to go to make it through to the end and that's all just working my way up toward being able to get my first job in this industry, but it feels good to have at least made it this far.</p>
          <p>Here are a few thoughts that I have on looking back on this module:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>I learned to get help when needed, but not too much help. On one hand, it's not good to stay stuck on a problem for too long, especially if it might be an easy fix that an outside eye might catch before you do. On the other hand, it's a great feeling when you figure something out on your own. Additionally, there can be a negative side to get too many opinions on how to start out a problem, especially if you're someone like me that has difficulty making decisions! At some point you need to picka path and just go with it.</li>
            <li>Exercised helped me so much when I needed to clear my mind at the end of the day. Even something as simple as a 7-minute workout helped to refresh a group of us when working late one night. Toward the last couple weeks of Module 1 I neglected to exercise because I was feeling such a time crunch, but in retrospect I think it would have been worth it to find a little time work out.</li>
            <li>I was really bad at getting enough sleep, again especially during the last two weeks. There were definitely late nights where I made very little progress on a problem and then came back to it the next day and finished it quite quickly in comparison to how much I had struggled the night before. As much as I think I want to power through something and get it done, I need to be more conscious about getting enough sleep to perform to my best ability.</li>
            <li>The above are things that are easy to tell yourself, but much harder to do</li>
          </ul>
